<h3>Analysis of Factors Influencing Academic Dropout Rates</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there any correlation between academic performance indicators and student dropout rates?<br>
The analysis focuses on three key performance indicators collected over five academic years (2016-2020): <em>average exam grades</em>, <em>number of honours</em> and <em>total ECTS credits earned</em>.<br>
The study aims to identify consistent patterns that could inform strategies to improve student retention.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>School dropout is a critical issue affecting educational institutions worldwide.<br>
Identifying the factors that contribute to dropout rates is essential for developing effective interventions.<br>
This study analyses historical data from 2016 to 2020, focusing on the relationship between academic performance and dropout rates.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Methodology</h4>
<p>The datasets for each year included variables such as age at enrolment, gender, type of school, geographical location, economic class and key academic performance indicators.<br>
The study focused on three variables: average exam grades, number of honours and total ECTS credits at the end of the first year of enrolment.<br>
The data were categorised into dropout and non-dropout groups.<br>
<a href="https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/915692">Welch's t-tests</a> were used to compare means between these groups, taking into account unequal variances and sample sizes.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>The analysis revealed significant differences in all three academic measures between dropouts and non-dropout students across all years.<br>
Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average exam grades</strong>: Dropout students consistently had lower average exam grades than their counterparts. Note that many students who dropped out did not take exams and were awarded a grade of 0 (and thus the average mark is low).<br>

<li><strong>Number of Honours</strong>: Where data was reliable (2018-2020), students who dropped out were awarded fewer honours.<br>

<li><strong>Total ECTS credits</strong>: Dropout students consistently earned fewer ECTS credits.<br>

</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>The results underline the strong correlation between academic performance and dropout rates.<br>
Lower exam marks and fewer credits indicate that academic difficulties are a key factor in the decision to drop out.<br>
This pattern was consistent across all years studied, indicating a persistent trend.</p>
